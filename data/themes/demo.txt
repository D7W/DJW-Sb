These are where all your themes are stored.
To create your own theme, create a new json file and use the following template : 

{
"title":"title",
"color":"hex_code_color",
"thumbnail":"image_address,
"footer":"footer"
}

Then, start the selfbot and run (prefix)settheme (theme/file name).

You can delete this file.
